This repository provides informatic tools to process gait data out of the Microsoft Kinect and apply machine learning to identify neurodevelomental risk in individuals. 

We refer users to the two vignettes explaining how raw Kinect data from gait records is processed, and then how machine learning was used to assess NDD risk in individual records.
